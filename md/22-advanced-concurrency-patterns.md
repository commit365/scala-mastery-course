# Advanced Concurrency Patterns in Scala

Concurrency is a critical aspect of modern software development, and Scala provides various advanced concurrency patterns to manage complexity and improve performance. This lesson covers Software Transactional Memory (STM), atomic operations, and reactive programming with Akka Streams and Monix.

## Software Transactional Memory (STM)

Software Transactional Memory is a concurrency control mechanism that allows multiple threads to read and write shared memory in a way that avoids conflicts and ensures consistency.

### Key Concepts of STM

1. **Transactions**: A transaction is a block of code that executes in isolation. It can read and write shared variables without interference from other transactions.

2. **Atomicity**: STM ensures that transactions are atomic, meaning they either complete fully or not at all.

3. **Isolation**: Transactions appear to execute in isolation from one another, preventing race conditions.

### Using STM in Scala

Scala provides libraries such as `scala-stm` for implementing STM.

1. **Add the dependency** to your `build.sbt`:

   ```sbt
   libraryDependencies += "org.scala-stm" %% "scala-stm" % "0.9"
   ```

2. **Example of STM Usage**:

```scala
import scala.concurrent.stm._

object STMExample {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val counter = Ref(0) // Create a reference to an integer

    // Define a transaction to increment the counter
    def increment(): Unit = atomic { implicit txn =>
      counter() = counter() + 1
    }

    // Run multiple increments in parallel
    val threads = (1 to 10).map { _ =>
      new Thread(() => {
        (1 to 1000).foreach(_ => increment())
      })
    }

    threads.foreach(_.start())
    threads.foreach(_.join())

    println(s"Final counter value: ${counter()}") // Outputs: Final counter value: 10000
  }
}
```

### Advantages of STM

- **Simplicity**: STM abstracts away the complexity of locks and provides a simple interface for managing shared state.
- **Composability**: Transactions can be composed, allowing you to build complex operations from simpler ones.
- **Deadlock Freedom**: STM avoids deadlocks by ensuring that transactions are retried if conflicts occur.

## Atomic Operations

Atomic operations are low-level operations that complete in a single step relative to other threads. They are essential for building lock-free data structures and ensuring data integrity.

### Example of Atomic Operations

Scala provides atomic references through the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package.

```scala
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger

object AtomicExample {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val atomicCounter = new AtomicInteger(0)

    // Define a method to increment the counter
    def increment(): Unit = {
      atomicCounter.incrementAndGet() // Atomic increment
    }

    // Run multiple increments in parallel
    val threads = (1 to 10).map { _ =>
      new Thread(() => {
        (1 to 1000).foreach(_ => increment())
      })
    }

    threads.foreach(_.start())
    threads.foreach(_.join())

    println(s"Final atomic counter value: ${atomicCounter.get()}") // Outputs: Final atomic counter value: 10000
  }
}
```

### Advantages of Atomic Operations

- **Performance**: Atomic operations are generally faster than locking mechanisms because they avoid context switching.
- **Simplicity**: They provide a simple interface for managing shared state without the complexity of locks.

## Reactive Programming with Akka Streams

Akka Streams is a library for building reactive applications using the actor model. It provides a way to process and manage streams of data in a non-blocking manner.

### Key Concepts of Akka Streams

1. **Source**: A source is a starting point for a stream of data.

2. **Flow**: A flow represents a transformation or processing step in the stream.

3. **Sink**: A sink is an endpoint that consumes the data from a stream.

### Example of Using Akka Streams

1. **Add the Akka Streams dependency** to your `build.sbt`:

   ```sbt
   libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-stream" % "2.6.16"
   ```

2. **Create a simple Akka Streams application**:

```scala
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import akka.stream.scaladsl.{Sink, Source}
import akka.stream.ActorMaterializer

object AkkaStreamsExample extends App {
  implicit val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem("MyActorSystem")
  implicit val materializer: ActorMaterializer = ActorMaterializer()

  // Create a source of numbers
  val source = Source(1 to 10)

  // Create a flow that squares each number
  val flow = source.map(x => x * x)

  // Create a sink that prints each number
  val sink = Sink.foreach[Int](println)

  // Run the stream
  flow.runWith(sink) // Outputs: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100
}
```

### Advantages of Akka Streams

- **Backpressure**: Akka Streams supports backpressure, allowing the system to handle varying data rates without overwhelming consumers.
- **Composition**: You can easily compose complex data processing pipelines using sources, flows, and sinks.

## Reactive Programming with Monix

Monix is another library for asynchronous programming and reactive streams in Scala. It provides a powerful way to work with observables and manage concurrency.

### Key Features of Monix

1. **Observables**: Monix provides `Observable`, which allows you to work with streams of data in a functional way.

2. **Task**: Monix's `Task` represents a computation that can be executed asynchronously.

3. **Composability**: Monix allows you to compose operations on observables and tasks easily.

### Example of Using Monix

1. **Add the Monix dependency** to your `build.sbt`:

   ```sbt
   libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "3.4.0"
   ```

2. **Create a simple Monix application**:

```scala
import monix.eval.Task
import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global
import monix.reactive.Observable

object MonixExample extends App {
  // Create an observable of numbers
  val observable = Observable.range(1, 11)

  // Process the observable
  val task: Task[Unit] = observable
    .map(x => x * x) // Square each number
    .foreach(x => println(x)) // Print each squared number

  // Run the task
  task.runSyncUnsafe() // Outputs: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100
}
```

### Advantages of Monix

- **Asynchronous and Concurrent**: Monix provides powerful abstractions for managing asynchronous computations and concurrency.
- **Integration with Cats Effect**: Monix integrates well with Cats Effect, allowing you to build type-safe and composable asynchronous applications.

## Practice Exercises

1. Implement a simple counter using Software Transactional Memory (STM) and demonstrate its usage with multiple threads.

2. Create a program that uses atomic operations to safely increment a shared counter from multiple threads.

3. Build a small application using Akka Streams to process a stream of integers, filter out even numbers, and print the results.

4. Write a Monix application that fetches data from a public API and processes the response asynchronously.

## Advanced Example: Combining Concurrency Patterns

Letâ€™s create a more complex example that combines STM, Akka Streams, and Monix:

```scala
import scala.concurrent.stm._
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import akka.stream.scaladsl.{Sink, Source}
import akka.stream.ActorMaterializer
import monix.eval.Task
import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global

object AdvancedConcurrencyExample extends App {
  implicit val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem("MyActorSystem")
  implicit val materializer: ActorMaterializer = ActorMaterializer()

  // Shared state using STM
  val counter = Ref(0)

  // Function to increment the counter atomically
  def incrementCounter(): Unit = atomic { implicit txn =>
    counter() = counter() + 1
  }

  // Create an Akka Stream source
  val source = Source(1 to 10)

  // Process the stream and increment the counter
  source.runForeach { _ =>
    incrementCounter()
  }

  // Create a Monix task to read the counter value
  val task: Task[Int] = Task {
    atomic { implicit txn =>
      counter()
    }
  }

  // Run the Monix task and print the counter value
  task.runAsync {
    case Right(value) => println(s"Final counter value: $value") // Outputs: Final counter value: 10
    case Left(ex) => println(s"Error: $ex")
  }
}
```

In this example:
- We use STM to manage a shared counter safely.
- We create an Akka Stream to process a sequence of numbers and increment the counter.
- We use Monix to read the final value of the counter asynchronously.
