# Best Practices and Design Patterns in Scala

In Scala, combining functional and object-oriented programming paradigms allows for expressive and maintainable code. This lesson covers best practices and design patterns in Scala, along with performance optimization techniques and benchmarking methods.

## Functional and Object-Oriented Design Patterns

### Functional Design Patterns

1. **Functor**: A functor is a type class that allows you to apply a function to a wrapped value. It provides a `map` method.

   ```scala
   trait Functor[F[_]] {
     def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]
   }
   ```

2. **Monad**: A monad is a type class that allows for chaining operations. It provides `flatMap` and `map`.

   ```scala
   trait Monad[F[_]] extends Functor[F] {
     def flatMap[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => F[B]): F[B]
     def pure[A](a: A): F[A]
   }
   ```

3. **Case Classes**: Use case classes for immutable data structures. They automatically provide `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods.

   ```scala
   case class User(name: String, age: Int)
   ```

4. **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as parameters or return them. They promote code reuse and abstraction.

   ```scala
   def applyTwice(f: Int => Int, x: Int): Int = f(f(x))
   ```

### Object-Oriented Design Patterns

1. **Singleton**: Use the singleton pattern to ensure a class has only one instance. In Scala, you can use the `object` keyword.

   ```scala
   object Database {
     def connect(): Unit = println("Connected to the database.")
   }
   ```

2. **Factory**: The factory pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class. Use companion objects for factory methods.

   ```scala
   class Animal(val name: String)

   object Animal {
     def apply(name: String): Animal = new Animal(name)
   }
   ```

3. **Decorator**: The decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

   ```scala
   trait Coffee {
     def cost: Double
   }

   class SimpleCoffee extends Coffee {
     def cost: Double = 2.0
   }

   class MilkDecorator(coffee: Coffee) extends Coffee {
     def cost: Double = coffee.cost + 0.5
   }
   ```

4. **Strategy**: The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

   ```scala
   trait SortingStrategy {
     def sort(data: List[Int]): List[Int]
   }

   class QuickSort extends SortingStrategy {
     def sort(data: List[Int]): List[Int] = data.sorted // Simplified for example
   }
   ```

## Performance Optimization Techniques

1. **Use Immutable Collections**: Immutable collections are generally more efficient in concurrent environments and can lead to fewer bugs.

2. **Avoid Unnecessary Boxing**: When working with primitive types, avoid boxing and unboxing, which can introduce overhead.

3. **Use Tail Recursion**: Scala optimizes tail-recursive functions to prevent stack overflow and improve performance.

   ```scala
   @scala.annotation.tailrec
   def factorial(n: Int, acc: Int = 1): Int = {
     if (n <= 1) acc
     else factorial(n - 1, n * acc)
   }
   ```

4. **Leverage Parallel Collections**: For CPU-bound tasks, consider using parallel collections to take advantage of multi-core processors.

   ```scala
   val numbers = (1 to 1000000).toList
   val sum = numbers.par.sum // Using parallel collection
   ```

5. **Profile and Benchmark**: Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and optimize critical sections of your code.

## Benchmarking Techniques

1. **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness)**: Use JMH to create accurate and reliable benchmarks for your Scala code.

   ```scala
   import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations._

   @State(Scope.Benchmark)
   class MyBenchmark {
     @Benchmark
     def testMethod(): Int = {
       // Code to benchmark
       (1 to 1000).sum
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Measure Execution Time**: For simple cases, you can measure execution time using `System.nanoTime`.

   ```scala
   val start = System.nanoTime()
   // Code to measure
   val end = System.nanoTime()
   println(s"Execution time: ${(end - start) / 1e6} ms")
   ```

3. **Use Profilers**: Tools like VisualVM, YourKit, or JProfiler can help analyze performance and memory usage.

## Practice Exercises

1. Implement a functor type class for a custom data type and demonstrate its usage.

2. Create a simple factory pattern for creating different types of shapes (e.g., Circle, Rectangle).

3. Write a decorator for a logging mechanism that adds logging functionality to an existing service.

4. Benchmark a recursive Fibonacci function and optimize it using memoization.

5. Use JMH to compare the performance of different sorting algorithms implemented in Scala.

## Advanced Example: Combining Design Patterns and Optimization

Letâ€™s create a more complex example that combines several design patterns and optimization techniques:

```scala
// Define a trait for a calculation strategy
trait CalculationStrategy {
  def calculate(a: Int, b: Int): Int
}

// Implement concrete strategies
class Addition extends CalculationStrategy {
  def calculate(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b
}

class Multiplication extends CalculationStrategy {
  def calculate(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a * b
}

// Create a context that uses a strategy
class Calculator(strategy: CalculationStrategy) {
  def execute(a: Int, b: Int): Int = strategy.calculate(a, b)
}

// Use a factory to create calculators
object CalculatorFactory {
  def createCalculator(operation: String): Calculator = {
    operation match {
      case "add" => new Calculator(new Addition)
      case "multiply" => new Calculator(new Multiplication)
      case _ => throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown operation")
    }
  }
}

// Usage
val addCalculator = CalculatorFactory.createCalculator("add")
println(addCalculator.execute(5, 3)) // Outputs: 8

val multiplyCalculator = CalculatorFactory.createCalculator("multiply")
println(multiplyCalculator.execute(5, 3)) // Outputs: 15
```

In this example:
- We define a `CalculationStrategy` trait for different calculation strategies.
- We implement concrete strategies for addition and multiplication.
- We create a `Calculator` class that uses a strategy to perform calculations.
- We use a factory to create calculators based on the desired operation.
