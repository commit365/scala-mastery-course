# Scala Ecosystem and Libraries

Scala has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that enhance its capabilities for various domains, including functional programming and web development. This lesson covers some of the most important libraries in the Scala ecosystem, focusing on Cats, Scalaz, ZIO for functional programming, and Http4s, Akka HTTP, and Play Framework for web development.

## Cats, Scalaz, and ZIO for Functional Programming

### Cats

Cats is a library that provides abstractions for functional programming in Scala. It includes type classes, data types, and functional programming utilities.

#### Key Features of Cats

1. **Type Classes**: Cats defines several type classes, such as `Functor`, `Applicative`, and `Monad`, which enable functional programming patterns.

2. **Data Types**: Cats provides data types like `Option`, `Either`, and `Validated`, which enhance error handling and data manipulation.

3. **Composability**: With Cats, you can compose functions and data types elegantly using functional constructs.

#### Example of Using Cats

```scala
import cats._
import cats.implicits._

val option1: Option[Int] = Some(2)
val option2: Option[Int] = Some(3)

// Using Applicative to combine options
val combined = (option1, option2).mapN(_ + _)
println(combined) // Outputs: Some(5)
```

### Scalaz

Scalaz is another library that provides functional programming abstractions and data types. It was one of the first libraries to introduce type classes to the Scala ecosystem.

#### Key Features of Scalaz

1. **Type Classes**: Similar to Cats, Scalaz defines type classes for functional programming.

2. **Data Structures**: Scalaz offers additional data structures and utilities for functional programming.

3. **Functional Effects**: Scalaz provides a powerful effect system for handling side effects in a functional way.

#### Example of Using Scalaz

```scala
import scalaz._
import Scalaz._

val option1: Option[Int] = Some(2)
val option2: Option[Int] = Some(3)

// Using Scalaz to combine options
val combined = (option1 |@| option2)(_ + _)
println(combined) // Outputs: Some(5)
```

### ZIO

ZIO is a library for asynchronous and concurrent programming in Scala. It focuses on providing a robust and type-safe way to handle effects and manage side effects.

#### Key Features of ZIO

1. **Effect System**: ZIO provides a powerful effect system that allows you to model side effects in a functional way.

2. **Concurrency**: ZIO supports structured concurrency, making it easier to manage concurrent tasks.

3. **Error Handling**: ZIO enables fine-grained error handling with compiler-tracked errors.

#### Example of Using ZIO

```scala
import zio._
import zio.console._

val program: ZIO[Console, Throwable, Unit] = for {
  _ <- putStrLn("Enter your name:")
  name <- getStrLn
  _ <- putStrLn(s"Hello, $name!")
} yield ()

object Main extends App {
  def run(args: List[String]): URIO[ZEnv, ExitCode] =
    program.exitCode
}
```

## Http4s, Akka HTTP, and Play Framework for Web Development

Scala provides several frameworks for building web applications, each with its own strengths and use cases.

### Http4s

Http4s is a purely functional library for building HTTP services in Scala. It provides a type-safe and composable way to define routes and handle requests.

#### Key Features of Http4s

1. **Type Safety**: Http4s leverages Scala's type system to ensure type-safe HTTP endpoints.

2. **Composability**: You can compose routes and middleware easily.

3. **Integration with Cats Effect**: Http4s is built on top of Cats Effect, enabling functional programming patterns.

#### Example of Using Http4s

```scala
import org.http4s._
import org.http4s.dsl.Http4sDsl
import org.http4s.blaze.server.BlazeServerBuilder
import cats.effect._

object Http4sExample extends IOApp {
  val dsl = Http4sDsl[IO]
  import dsl._

  val service = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
    case GET -> Root / "hello" => Ok("Hello, World!")
  }

  val httpApp = service.orNotFound

  def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = 
    BlazeServerBuilder[IO]
      .bindHttp(8080, "localhost")
      .withHttpApp(httpApp)
      .serve
      .compile
      .drain
      .as(ExitCode.Success)
}
```

### Akka HTTP

Akka HTTP is a toolkit for building HTTP-based services using the Akka actor model. It provides a flexible and powerful way to handle HTTP requests and responses.

#### Key Features of Akka HTTP

1. **Actor-Based Model**: Leverages the Akka actor model for handling concurrency and scalability.

2. **Routing DSL**: Provides a concise DSL for defining routes and handling requests.

3. **Streaming Support**: Supports streaming of requests and responses.

#### Example of Using Akka HTTP

```scala
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import akka.http.scaladsl.Http
import akka.http.scaladsl.model._
import akka.http.scaladsl.server.Directives._
import akka.stream.ActorMaterializer
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContextExecutor

object AkkaHttpExample extends App {
  implicit val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem("my-system")
  implicit val materializer: ActorMaterializer = ActorMaterializer()
  implicit val executionContext: ExecutionContextExecutor = system.dispatcher

  val route =
    path("hello") {
      get {
        complete(HttpResponse(entity = "Hello, World!"))
      }
    }

  Http().bindAndHandle(route, "localhost", 8080)
  println("Server online at http://localhost:8080/")
}
```

### Play Framework

Play Framework is a full-stack web framework that provides a reactive model for building web applications. It supports both Scala and Java.

#### Key Features of Play Framework

1. **Reactive Architecture**: Built on the principles of reactive programming, allowing for non-blocking I/O.

2. **Built-in Support for JSON**: Provides easy handling of JSON data.

3. **Hot Reloading**: Supports hot reloading for rapid development.

#### Example of Using Play Framework

```scala
import play.api.mvc._
import play.api.routing.Router
import play.api.{Application, BuiltInComponentsFromContext, Environment, Mode}
import play.api.routing.sird._

class MyController(cc: ControllerComponents) extends AbstractController(cc) {
  def hello() = Action {
    Ok("Hello, World!")
  }
}

class MyComponents(context: ApplicationLoader.Context)
  extends BuiltInComponentsFromContext(context) {

  lazy val router: Router = Router.from {
    case GET(p"/hello") => new MyController(controllerComponents).hello()
  }
}

// Main application entry point
object Main extends App {
  // Start Play application
  // Additional code to run the application would go here
}
```

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a simple REST API using Http4s that supports CRUD operations for a resource (e.g., books).

2. Implement a basic Akka HTTP service that responds with a JSON object.

3. Use the Play Framework to create a web application that serves static files and handles form submissions.

4. Build a simple application using ZIO to handle asynchronous HTTP requests and responses.

## Advanced Example: Combining Libraries

Letâ€™s create a more complex example that combines different libraries for a web application:

```scala
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import akka.http.scaladsl.Http
import akka.http.scaladsl.model._
import akka.http.scaladsl.server.Directives._
import akka.stream.ActorMaterializer
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContextExecutor
import zio._
import zio.console._

object CombinedExample extends App {
  implicit val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem("my-system")
  implicit val materializer: ActorMaterializer = ActorMaterializer()
  implicit val executionContext: ExecutionContextExecutor = system.dispatcher

  // ZIO effect to handle logging
  def logMessage(message: String): ZIO[Console, Throwable, Unit] =
    putStrLn(message)

  // Akka HTTP route
  val route =
    path("hello") {
      get {
        val response = "Hello, World!"
        // Log the response using ZIO
        Runtime.default.unsafeRun(logMessage(response))
        complete(HttpResponse(entity = response))
      }
    }

  Http().bindAndHandle(route, "localhost", 8080)
  println("Server online at http://localhost:8080/")
}
```

In this example:
- We create an Akka HTTP server that responds to requests.
- We use ZIO for logging messages, demonstrating how to combine different libraries.

## Conclusion

The Scala ecosystem offers a rich set of libraries and frameworks for functional programming and web development. Libraries like Cats, Scalaz, and ZIO provide powerful abstractions for functional programming, while Http4s, Akka HTTP, and Play Framework enable building robust web applications.

By mastering these libraries and understanding their capabilities, you can create scalable, maintainable, and high-performance applications in Scala.
